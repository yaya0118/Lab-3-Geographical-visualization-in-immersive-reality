## Reflective analysis
This 3D map highlights the famous location of Vancouver. To provide 3D immersive visualization, I used Xcode and Unity. To produce this map, I found the useful data from Mapbox and added the access token into Unity. That I can get the basemap for my assignment. Moreover, I added the city data by change latitude and longtitude. Besides, in order to show the buildings more accurate by change the mapbox style, topographical trend, building materials and other attributes features in the Hierarchy function to open the Inspector to see and edit the settings.

This map was designed for people who want to explore downtown Vancouver. The top of Vancouver is a famous place that attracts a lot of tourists. This map visualizes the names on the main street. It also indicates the height of the building and the basic infrastructure shape. 

In this assignment, I tried different applications. Such as A-frame, Xcode and so on. As conventional computer displays with trackpad, mouse and keyboard exvel at 2D tasks such as writing and studying research literature. Adding Virtual Reality to the conventional computing environment could improve 3D capabilities. I think immersive visualization of molecular and cellular structure has been employed for education, communicating results, and research data analysis is really useful in this modern environment.

There are lots of limitation in this 3D map. For example, there are no interactivities and did not use enough coding to run the program. Immersive visualization is an accessible, easy-to-use technology that turns 3D BIM (Building Information Modeling) models into engaging visual architecture experiences that users can explore. These tools help architects to refine and reshape their design processâ€”from initial concept to final design review. A good 3D map can let reader has better understand on the issues they concerned.

When architects can step into their design to walk through the space, validate changes, and better understand the impact of their decisions, they can improve their design and improve client satisfaction.
